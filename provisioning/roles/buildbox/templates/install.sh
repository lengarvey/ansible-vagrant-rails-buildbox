You can now run the Buildbox agent like so:

  $DESTINATION/buildbox-agent start --access-token token123

You can find your agent's Access Token on your Account Settings
page under \"Agents\".

To customize how builds are run on your server, you can edit:

  $DESTINATION/bootstrap.sh

This file is run for every build and it's responsible for checking out
the source code and running the build script.

The source code of the agent is available here:

  https://github.com/buildboxhq/buildbox-agent

If you have any questions or need a help getting things setup,

Happy Building!
